# Data-visualization-using-D3-Choropleth-Map

data visualization using D3.js, the visualization have been proceeded through choropleth map.

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://choropleth-map.freecodecamp.rocks.

You can use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library. 
Required DOM elements are queried on the moment of each test. If you use a frontend framework (like Vue for example), the test results may be inaccurate for dynamic content. We hope to accommodate them eventually, but these frameworks are not currently supported for D3 projects.

Here are the datasets you will need to complete this project:

US Education Data:https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/for_user_education.json

US County Data:https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/data/choropleth_map/counties.json
